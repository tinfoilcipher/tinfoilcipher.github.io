This page is a collection of my personal projects, focused on how to build real world infrastructure solutions for personal use with using primarily Free Open Source Software (but always free) and low cost hardware for a best effect.

[Building a Bare Metal Kubernetes Lab]({{ 'building-a-bare-metal-kubernetes-lab-part-1/index.html' | relative_url }})

Setup and configuration of a bare metal Kubernetes home lab using VMWare VMs. With deep dives in to the configuration of a highly available Control Plane, PKI configuration and managing the network challenges that come with a bare metal deployment.

[Terraform Modules](https://registry.terraform.io/namespaces/tinfoilcipher)

Public Terraform Modules in the official registry for various niche use cases that arenâ€™t well covered by existing solutions and are a little too fussy to put together manually.

[Resilient Infrastructure on a Shoestring]({{ 'resiliant-infrastructure-on-a-shoestring/index.html' | relative_url }})

Setup of a resilient personal infrastructure at low cost, providing Linux VM hosting on a VMWare platform, segregated networking (firewall and dot1q VLANs), redundant storage and backups.

[Simple IP/HTTP Monitoring Server](https://github.com/tinfoilcipher/simple-monitoring-tool)

A simple IP and HTTP/S monitoring solution implemented in Python and Docker for use in very small networks and homelabs without the overhead of setting up a large infrastructure. Provides uptime monitoring and email alerting on a schedule.

[Secure Home VPN]({{ 'secure-home-vpn/index.html' | relative_url }})

Setup of a secure VPN for personal use at no cost, leveraging a Linux Operating System and the OpenVPN Access Server platform and allowing the use of MFA against for use on Windows, Linux, Android and iOS clients.

[Lightweight Internal DNS and Certificate Authority]({{ 'bind-dns-and-openssl-certificate-authority/index.html' | relative_url }})

Setup of a lightweight BIND9 internal DNS server and lightweight CA leveraging a Linux platform and tinyCA2 to issue certificates in conjunction with the DNS naming issued from BIND.

[WPA-EAP TLS (802.1X) WiFi]({{ 'wpa-eap-tls-wifi/index.html' | relative_url }})

Setup of personal 802.1x Enterprise Grade WiFi deployment using freeradius and openssl to provide enterprise grade WiFi security to a personal deployment that is compatible with any wireless access point which supports the WPA-EAP protocol.
