I'm starting a blog about DevOps tools and technology, aimed at people who can't work out how this stuff works and find the documentation and concepts impenetrable.

After a while of teaching myself I'm starting to realise that it isn't just me that's struggling to figure stuff out and there's a lot of people that don't want to admit that they don't understand things.

I'm not sure how this is going to shake out or if anyone is going to be interested so we'll see how it goes!
